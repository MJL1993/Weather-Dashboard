Description:

This is a weather dashboard webpage used to search for current weather data in a particular city. 

When the user searches for a city, the website displays the following current weather data for the day:
- City name & date
- Sun, Rain Cloud, Cloud, or Partly Cloudy icon to indicate sky conditions
- Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind speed
- UV Index (color coded to show severity)
- 5-day forecast which also displays date, sky conditions icons, temperature, and humidity

Also, when the user searches a city, that city is immediately prepended as a new button in the "Search History" card to be used again if the user wishes.
